# Top-Down-Adventure-Game
The goal for this project is to create a top down, 2d, adventure game similar to the original Legend of Zelda. While the basic mechanics and structure will be based off of the original, For those of you who are not familiar with the original Zelda, here is a link to the wikipedia for the game.

You may also want to find an online emulator or look up screenshots of the game to get a basic idea of the mechanics.
  

# GOALS
• Playable character <br/>
  ◦ Inventory with at least 3 collectible items (bombs, keys, money . . .)<br/>
  ◦ Health<br/>
  ◦ Weapon to fight enemies<br/>
• Explorable World<br/>
  ◦ At least 9 screens worth of explorable content (3x3 grid is one way to structure the screens)<br/>
  ◦ A map the player can view to see where in the world they currently are<br/>
  ◦ One screen should be the player’s end goal. Reaching this screen will result in the player winning the game.<br/>
  ◦ One dungeon the player can enter. This dungeon should contain some sort of key item that allows the player to reach the final screen (see previous point).<br/>
  ◦ Screens should have obstacles scattered about (rocks, trees, debris, water . . .)
• Enemies
  ◦ At least 3 types of enemies the player can encounter.
  ◦ Each enemy type should have some sort of unique quality (more health, faster, . . .)
  ◦ These enemies should be able to both take and give damage to the player character.
  ◦ They should move around the screen, avoiding any obstacles which may inhabit the screen (rocks, trees . . .)
• Pause Menu
◦ Menu that allows the player to exit the game, save, load, view the map, view inventory, and any other information that the player might need for their journey.
• Music
◦ Background music to play during the travels.

OVERVIEW
  At the simplest level the game will consist of the player needing to find a key item which allows them to progress to the final screen. Reaching this final screen will result in the player winning. The player loses when the player character runs out of health. Besides, there are also some “Wow! Factor”. Some examples are given below.
Examples:
  • Final boss to fight
  • Dynamic events

MILESTONES
Below are the week-by-week expectations for the project.
  Week 1:
    • Complete outline and roadmap for your game
    • Basic UML for the classes you expect you will need
    • Start on back-end for game (data structures to hold world, player, enemies)
    • Decide on Wow! Factor
  Week 2:
    • Significant work on back-end and engine (physics, collision, . . .)
    • Work on front-end gui (transition between screens, menus . . .)
  Week 3:
    • Finished front-end
    • Animations
    • Music
• Cleanup work
